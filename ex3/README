Part 1:
Took 682.
Part 2:
Q1: We first looked at functions with the word "time" in them, and found DoTimer() (0x01002fe0),
We changed the "jz short locret_1003007" to  "jmp     short locret_1003007" so the function wont do anything.
The timer then still jumped to 1, so We looked for inc _cSec, and found it at 0x0100382A, and changed the inc and the call to PlayTune to NOPS.
Q2: We found the SetTimer command in MSDN doc, then found it in the code (0x0100384F) and changed the timeout param from 1000ms to 500ms.(0x0100383D)
Q3:
changed where the timer is increased to decrease instead.(0x01002FF5 DoTimer ,0x01003830 ButtonDown)

before these DEC calls there were checks to compare the timer to 0 and 999 (0 in ButtonDown to initiate the timer 0x01003821, and 999 in DoTimer to stop counting 0x01002FE9)
these were changed to jumps to my new code (ButtonDown jumps to 0x01004a60, DoTimer jumps to 0x01004A7F) which is explained below.

01004A60      833D 9C570001 00      CMP DWORD PTR DS:[100579C],0             ; from ButtonDown if timer is 0 (game hasnt started) set the timer to 121 (will be decreased by 1 and displayed as 120)
01004A67      75 11                 JNE SHORT 01004A7A
01004A69      C705 9C570001 7900000 MOV DWORD PTR DS:[100579C],79            ; set _cSec to 121
01004A73      833D 9C570001 79      CMP DWORD PTR DS:[100579C],79            ; compare to 121 so the jump wont be taken
01004A7A    ^ E9 A7EDFFFF           JMP 01003826                             ; go back to the ButtonDown
01004A7F      833D 9C570001 00      CMP DWORD PTR DS:[100579C],0             ; from DoTimer (if timer reaches 0, call GameOver(False), otherwise, return normaly)
01004A86      75 13                 JNE SHORT 01004A9B                       ; if not 0 jump
01004A88      6A 00                 PUSH 0                                   ; false - if timer = 0 call GameOver(False) = Loss
01004A8A      E8 EDE9FFFF           CALL 0100347C                            ; GameOver(false) = loss
01004A8F      833D 9C570001 00      CMP DWORD PTR DS:[100579C],0             ; Compare _cSec to 0 and reutrn to DoTimer for normal flow
01004A96    ^ E9 56E5FFFF           JMP 01002FF1
01004A9B    ^ E9 55E5FFFF           JMP 01002FF5                             ; jump to the Decrease Timer

Q4: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\winmine
	Name1 & Time1 for Beginner
	Name2 & Time2 for Intermediate
	Name3 & Time3 for Expert

	0x01002DAB: WritePreferences()

Q5: 0x1005330 Number of mines on the board.
	0x1005334 width of the board.
	0x1005338 Height of the board.
	0x1005340 + 0x20 * (y+1) + (x+1) for cell x,y where x,y are 0 based (the +1 is due to the representation x,y being 1 based and ours is zero based).

To find the representation we first looked at the stack in olly but didn't see anything interesting there.
We then looked at the data section in IDA and seen:
.data:01005334 _xBoxMac        dd ?                    ; DATA XREF: AdjustWindow
.data:01005334                                         ; MainWndProc
.data:01005338 _yBoxMac        dd ?                    ; DATA XREF: AdjustWindow
.data:01005338                                         ; MainWndProc
.data:0100533C                 align 10h
.data:01005340 _rgBlk          dd ?                    ; DATA XREF: MainWndProc
.data:01005340                                         ; DisplayBlk
.data:01005344                 db    ? ;
...
.data:01005360 dword_1005360   dd ?                    ; DATA XREF: DrawGrid
.data:01005360                                         ; ClearField
Where the `dword_1005360` was a really big block of memory that was used in `DrawGrid`

Inside `DrawGrid` we found:
.text:010026B0                 cmp     _yBoxMac, eax
.text:010026CC                 cmp     _xBoxMac, esi
.text:010026EC                 push    _MemBlkDc[eax*4] ; HDC
.text:01002700                 call    ds:__imp__BitBlt@36 ; BitBlt(x,x,x,x,x,x,x,x,x)
Which seemed to suggest this was the board representation.
We then ran olly again and looked at this area in memory and noticed that it changed as we changed the board, from there it was a matter of iterpreting the representation bytes and the cooridate system.

The symbols:
0x0F	UNREVEALED_EMPTY
0x8F	UNREVEALED_MINE
0x0D	QUESTION_MARK
0x0E	FLAG
0x8A	REVEALED_MINE
0xCC	TRIGGERED_MINE
0x0B	WRONG_FLAG
0x8D	UNREVEALED_MINE_QUESTION
0x8E	UNREVEALED_MINE_FLAG
0x40+d	square with d wrotten on it.
0x10	this is a marker to an end of row of mine and also marks the start and end of board

Q6:
Legend:
UNREVEALED_EMPTY_CHAR '.'
REVEALED_MINE_CHAR 'M'
UNREVEALED_MINE_QUESTION_CHAR '!'
UNREVEALED_MINE_FLAG_CHAR '$'
UNREVEALED_MINE_CHAR '*'
QUESTION_MARK_CHAR '?'
FLAG_CHAR 'F'
TRIGGERED_MINE_CHAR 'D'
WRONG_FLAG_CHAR 'E'
Numbers The number
if a char is found and we didnt define it, it will be shown as #

Bonus:
We knew that the orginal cheat colors a pixel according to the mine, so we looked for SetPixel in the IDB. we found a string next to it caled
XYZZY (which was the cheat code), we looked for that, and found 3 parts that deal with it. (named in IDB as CHEAT_1 2 3)
and the location of the text XYZZY in unicode in the data section (0x01005034) the data was changed to GOD so GOD will be matched 
and the parts that comapre _iXYZZY counter to 5, were modified to compare to 3, so only 3 chars will be compared.

Remarks
-------
I didnt change the cheat activation to shit+enter (lack of time). so just shift is enough.
The trainer.c file is actually a cpp file but we changed it to .c for the presubmit script. It still should work ok in visual studio but we didn't get a chance to check that. In any case changing the extension to .cpp will work.
